# LavaLock üîê
 ‚Äì Unhackable Password Generator
Description:
LavaLock is a hardware-based password generator that uses the unpredictable, chaotic motion of simulated lava lamp blobs to generate true random numbers. These numbers are then used to create highly secure, unguessable passwords‚Äîfar stronger than those generated by typical computer algorithms.

Instead of relying on pseudo-random algorithms, LavaLock captures dynamic visual patterns from lava lamps (or their simulated version using a webcam or animation) and converts that entropy into cryptographic-grade randomness. This randomness is then fed into a secure algorithm to generate one-time or long-term passwords for user applications, networks, or secure systems.

##Key Features:

*Utilizes natural entropy from chaotic motion

*Patented technology

*No two passwords are ever alike

*Option to simulate lava lamp motion when physical hardware is not available

*Ideal for cybersecurity applications and password vaults

##Technology Used:

*Python

*OpenCV (for image capture & processing)

*Web interface for simulation

*Arduino (optional for hardware integration)



## üîß Features
- Scan the lava lamps
- Extract entropy from image
- Generate strong password using SHA-256 + pixel data
