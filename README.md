# Lavalock
LavaLock is a hardware-based password generator that uses the unpredictable, chaotic motion of simulated lava lamp blobs to generate true random numbers. These numbers are then used to create highly secure, unguessable passwordsâ€”far stronger than those generated by typical computer algorithms.
